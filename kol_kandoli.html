        <section id="history">
            <h2>History</h2>
            <p>The temple holds ancient significance as the starting point of the Nav Durga Yatra. According to legends, it was established as a mark of Goddess Durga's first manifestation.
                In the Mahabharata era, during the Pandavas' exile (Agyat Vaas), they learned of the Goddess in Nagraj village. They visited her shrine, praying for the end of their exile and the recovery of their kingdom. The Goddess appeared to them and instructed them to construct a temple in her honor. This temple was built in a single night but took six months to complete.

                Within the temple grounds, there is a well known as the "Mother's Well." Devotees feel a sense of peace and relaxation after drinking its water, and it is believed to purify the body when sprinkled over the skin.

                The temple's calming atmosphere helps soothe both the body and mind. It is said that the flowers offered to the Goddess here undergo a special process and transform into Bhasm (Babooti), which is believed to cure skin ailments when consumed or applied to affected areas.

            <h2>Spiritual Significance</h2>
            <p>The temple symbolizes the divine energy of the Goddess and provides spiritual solace to visitors. It is believed that praying here fulfills wishes and brings peace.
                According to local legend, Mata Vaishno Devi manifested here at the age of 5 as a little girl and meditated for 12 years. After completing her penance, she settled in the form of a pindi at this temple. It is believed that the Goddess herself appears in the form of this natural pindi, granting the wishes of her devotees.

                During her penance, the Goddess played marbles and swung with local girls in the area. She also performed several havans (rituals) for world peace. It is said that Mahamaya presented silver bowls to the temple on four occasions, each time offering 36 different types of food to 330 million deities.
